In this project I practiced PCA decomposition to compress an image. I used TensorFlow library to find SVD and numpy for some calculations and operations.
Surprisingly, with just a 50 components (and that's 5x compression!) the image looks decent. 
You can simply try these by downloading .ipynb file, putting image you want to compress in the same folder and changing the filename and file_extension in the second cell.
It's as simple as that!
